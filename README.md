## Run Instructions
To compile and run the code in the command line:
```bash

  javac Main.java
  java Main
  
```

A menu will appear asking which algorithm you would like to use. Enter 1, 2, 3, or 4 to select the algorithm. The code will then read in the hash table, run the algorithm, and print the best matching sequence as well as its similarity score. 

If you chose longestCommonSebsequence or LongestCommonSubstring another message will appear asking if you want to see what the actual subsequence or substring is. Enter y or n. If you enter y, the longestCommonSebsequence/Substring will display on the console. 

You can now enter 1, 2, 3, or 4 to select the algorithm to run or -1 to quit.
